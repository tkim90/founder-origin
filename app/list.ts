    story: "Founder Edwin Chen, a former Google and Meta engineer, leveraged his knowledge of pain points and his connections in the industry to validate the product and secure initial customers among well-known names such as Airbnb and Twitch. Surge's earliest projects focused on solving core problems for these companies: improving search, recommendation engines, and content moderation through higher quality, expert-matched data labeling.",

    "story": "Founder Yasser Elsaid built Chatbase (initially as a solo engineer) as a custom-chatbot platform that allowed website owners to embed chat agents trained on their own data. He used growth via Twitter and Reddit to attract early adopters who were solving their own mid-sized problems, kept the product lightweight, and focused on self-serve. The first customers came from this word-of-mouth / community outreach kernel.",

    "story": "Founded in 2022 by Winston Weinberg (a junior lawyer) and Gabe Pereyra (ex-DeepMind/Meta researcher), Harvey targeted the legal industry. They got their first large customer when global law firm Allen & Overy decided to roll out their tool to ~3,500 attorneys in early 2023. That early big-law engagement served as proof-point and then unlocked momentum across the AmLaw 100 and large law firms.",

    "story": "Retell AI, a voice-agent platform, landed early customers by building compelling case studies in high-volume use-cases — for example telemedicine provider Doxy.me made Retell the first contact point for free-users, and others like Sunshine Loans and AccioJob used Retell to handle thousands of calls with minimal human overhead. These case studies helped them land further customers quickly.",

    "story": "Cursor (by Anysphere) targeted developers first: the product shipped in Jan 2023, and early adopters included engineers at OpenAI and other elite tech companies. These developers found value, paid out-of-pocket, and championed the product internally. That grassroots adoption then translated to enterprise deals. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}",

They leveraged their voice-actor marketplace (actors upload voices → developers pick them) and enabled early users via self-serve. From creators and small customers to content publishers and enterprises, this build-up triggered broader adoption.",

That real world production deployment in logistics operations helped them refine the product and then land further logistics enterprise customers (DHL, Ryder etc.).",
